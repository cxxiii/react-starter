## Webdev Starter ðŸš€ (WIP)

This is a simple, light-weight boilerplate for getting started quickly with a web dev project.

The idea is to enable you to dive right in on a project idea without having to spend any time/energy on setup and config, yet with all the essential
DX features, such as hot reloading and optimized production builds.

**Disclaimer**: This is an early version and mostly catering to my own purposes for now.

### Getting Started

#### Basic

1. Run `yarn start` to start the development server (`localhost:8080`).
2. Start coding by editing the starter files in the `src` folder.
3. When done, run `yarn build` to create an optimized production build.

### TODO

- [ ] Flesh out this README
- [ ] More and better scripts
- [ ] Create branch for `npm` users
