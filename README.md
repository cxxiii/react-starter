## Webdev Starter ðŸš€ (WIP)

This is a simple, light-weight boilerplate for getting started quickly with a new web development project.

The idea is to be able to dive right in on a project idea without having to spend any time/energy on setup and config, yet with all the essential
DX features, such as hot reloading and optimized production builds.

You're also not locked into any JavaScript framework (or using the language at all), but you can easily extend the boilerplate with commands like `yarn setup:react`.

**Disclaimer**: This is an early version and mostly catering to my own learning purposes for now.

### Getting Started

#### Basic

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn start` to start the development server (`localhost:8080`).
2. Start coding by editing the starter files in the `src` folder.
3. When done, run `yarn build` to create a production build.

### TODO

- [ ] Flesh out this README
- [ ] More and better scripts
- [ ] Create branch for `npm` users
- [ ] Add useful links/resources section
