## Webdev Starter (WIP)

This is a simple, light-weight boilerplate for getting started quickly with a web dev project.

Disclaimer: This is an early version and mostly catering to my own purposes for now.

### Basics

1. Run `yarn start` to start the development server (`localhost:8080`)
2. Start coding
3. When done, run `yarn build` to create a production build 

### TODO

- [ ] Complete README
- [ ] More and better scripts
